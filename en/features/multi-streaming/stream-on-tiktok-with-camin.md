You can send your stream to multiple live platforms, like Twitch, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, at the same time. Just connect to them the same way as your connecting to Tiktok.

### Requirements <a href="#zhu-yi-shi-xiang" id="zhu-yi-shi-xiang"></a>

1. You must be at least 18 years old and have at least 1,000 followers on TikTok.&#x20;
2. Even if you meet these requirements and are able to go live on their mobile app, access to TikTok's RTMP streaming feature is not guaranteed.
3. The stream key is not permanent. You need to get a new one from TikTok and update it on Restream for each new stream.
