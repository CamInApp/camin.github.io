# Multi-streaming

## Introduction

CamIn is a powerful streaming software that allows you to broadcast your live streams to multiple platforms simultaneously such as YouTube, Twitch, X, TikTok, etc.

CamIn supports two methods of live streaming: one is streaming via RTMP, and the other is using the **CamIn virtual camera** with the official Live Studio provided by the streaming platform. This tutorial will guide you through the steps to set up and use CamIn for multi-platform live streaming.

## Equipment requirements

2. **Operating System**
   * Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher
   * Mac: macOS 10.15 or higher

### Starting Streaming

Once you've completed the stream configuration, click "Start Streaming" in CamIn. Please note that some streaming platforms may also require you to click _start streaming_ on their platform. Make sure to complete this step as well.

## Live Streaming via CamIn Virtual Camera

Since some live streaming platforms do not provide or allow access to streaming RTMP URL and Stream Keys, such as TikTok, in this case, you can use CamIn Virtual Camera in the Live Studio provided by these platforms for live streaming.

Here‚Äôs the method using TikTok Live Studio as an example:

### Setting Up Your Stream

Set up any overlays or other sources you want to include in CamIn. For detailed steps, refer to CamIn manual.

Once the camera setup is complete, you can open CamIn to start live streaming.

This method also applies to other platforms, such as WeChat channel-live, etc.

## **Notes:**

1. The channel's user name, RTMP URL, and stream key are required options. You need to obtain this information from the platform you want to stream to.
2. You must configure at least one platform to start your live stream.
3. All content in the preview area will be streamed to viewers. The settings area, brush panel, and other software interface elements will not be streamed, so feel free to use them.
4. During the live stream, you cannot switch streaming platforms. You need to stop the current stream, reselect the streaming platform, and then start the live stream again.
5. CamIn currently does not support recording live streams; you can enable live playback on the streaming platform instead.
