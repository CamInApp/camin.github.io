# What to Do If Screen Mirroring Fails?

If screen mirroring fails to initiate, first check your network to ensure that both your mobile device and computer are connected to the same network (LAN).

If screen mirroring still fails even on the same network, consider disabling the computer firewall. Here are the steps for disabling the firewall on different operating systems:

### **For Windows:**

1. Click the "Start" button, then select "Settings" > "Update & Security" > "Windows Security" and "Firewall & network protection."
2. Choose the network profile: Domain network, Private network, or Public network.
3. Under "Microsoft Defender Firewall," switch the setting to "Off."

### **For macOS (Apple computers):**

1. In the Apple menu, choose “System Settings” Click on “Network” in the sidebar list.&#x20;
2. Click on “Firewall” Toggle the switch for Firewall to the OFF position.
